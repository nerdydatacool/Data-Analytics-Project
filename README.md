 Diabetes Data Analytics Project – Power BI End-to-End Dashboard
 Project Overview
This end-to-end data analytics project leverages Power BI to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize diabetes data. The goal is to create an interactive, insight-rich dashboard that can help healthcare professionals, analysts, and stakeholders understand the key drivers of diabetes and support data-driven decisions.

Dataset Information
Attributes:
Glucose
BloodPressure
Insulin
BMI
Age

Objectives
Clean and transform raw diabetes data for visualization
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with key metrics
Identify and highlight potential risk factors for diabetes
Enable stakeholder exploration through filters and slicers

Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Data modeling, dashboard development
Power Bi : Power query


Workflow Overview
1. Data Import
Load the CSV dataset into Power BI using Power Query Editor.

2. Data Cleaning
Create calculated columns:
Age Group (e.g., 20–30, 30–40, etc.)
BMI Category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
Risk Label (based on threshold combinations)

3. Data Modeling
Ensure a clean data model with meaningful relationships (if using additional tables).
Define measures using DAX:
Diabetes rate
Average Glucose, BMI, Age by Outcome
Percentage of diabetic patients in each segment

4. Dashboard Design
Create a multi-page Power BI dashboard with:
Introduction
Demographics Analysis
Visualizations for Glucose, Insulin, Blood Pressure
Risk classification by BMI and Glucose ranges
Filters & Slicers
Age group
BMI category
Outcome (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic)
Diabetic count


5. Insights & Recommendations
Highlight trends such as:
Higher glucose levels correlate with diabetes outcome
Most diabetic cases occur in older and obese individuals
Certain BMI and glucose thresholds show high-risk groups
